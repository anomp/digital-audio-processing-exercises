# Exercises on Digital Audio Processing

The current repository was implemented for the course *Digital Audio Technology* ([University of Patras, Department of Electrical Engineering, ECE-AK809](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/el/undergraduate/under-courses/ece-ak809-psifiaki-texnologia-ixou.html)), during the Winter Semester 2020.

In the present implementation, the goal is to demonstrate the fundamental Python libraries and tools to visualize and process audio. The initial educational content was provided by the course educational team in MATLAB. The current repository contains the equivalent content in Python.

## Installation
In order to provide an interactive presentation of audio processing tools, the exercises are implemented as jupyter notebooks. In order to run the exercises locally:

1. Install Jupyter Notebooks by running `pip install notebook`
1. Clone the current repository.
1. Cd to the repository directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `jupyter notebook`


## TODO
Update comments and explanations wherever they are missing.
